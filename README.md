# Obsidian Monolog: AI-Assisted Personal Knowledge System

This repository hosts the codebase for an advanced AI-Assisted Personal Knowledge System, a tool designed to streamline and enhance knowledge management and personal information organization. The system leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of the ChatGPT API to handle all knowledge management tasks, allowing users to "mentally regurgitate" information in a free-form, unstructured manner. 

The user interface is a straightforward chat client built into Obsidian, with two distinct types of messages: 

1. **Monolog**: These are messages that the system will read, understand, and incorporate into its knowledge base but not reply to. This allows for quick, unstructured input of information into the system.

2. **Dialog**: These are interactive messages to which the system will respond. It's here that users can query their stored information, ask for insights, and engage in meaningful discussions with the AI.

In essence, this system aims to be a powerful, AI-assisted brain extension, capable of storing and managing information, and dialoguing in a meaningful and insightful manner. It's your personal cognitive assistant, powered by the ChatGPT API. 

## Key Features:
* Intuitive and user-friendly chat interface.
* Seamless knowledge management powered by the ChatGPT API.
* Dynamic interaction modes: Monolog and Dialog.
* AI-enhanced recall and learning from stored information.
* Personalized insights and recommendations.
